# Analysis the performance of machine learning models on anonymized data

The large amount of open data available makes it necessary to study and develop techniques that guarantee its security for processing and analysis. Specifically, the study of
anonymization techniques focuses on analyzing the distribution of the quasi-identifiers
and sensitive attributes in a database. There are numerous techniques that can be applied,
each of which can prevent different types of attacks.

The present study explores three classical anonymity techniques, their implementation
and the several kind of attacks they prevent: k-anonymity, â„“-diversity and t-closeness.
Specifically, different algorithms are implemented to ensure the reliability of these techniques and are applied at various levels on two open-access datasets.
Next, the performance of a battery of Machine Learning models applied on the anonymized data is studied. A wide range of experimental results is carried out, varying the
anonymization technique employed, as well as the level established.
All the code developed is written in Python, as well as the implementation of the algorithms used to accomplish the anonymization process with each technique presented,
and is distributed through an open source repository

## Brief summary of results
